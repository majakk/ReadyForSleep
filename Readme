This is a regular windows program (tested on Windows 10) for visuializing when the computer is ready to go to sleep. 
Usually windows does not tell this and many things can stall it from going to sleep e.g. sound and video.
A heart shows its state - if green, then its ready for sleep - if yellow, one thing is blocking - if red, two or
more things are blocking it from sleep. Unfortunately this system information can only be retrieved as administrator
(which is quite weird actually) so the program will ask for such rights when installed. Cheers!
